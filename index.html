            <p>I love Korean food.  It might have something to do with the fact that I am a Korean. I was born and raised in Daejeon, South Korea.  
            Even though my mom was a good cook, I didn&apos;t know much about cooking when I got married.  Not only did I have to learn how to cook, 
            but I also had to learn to cook American food for my husband who was born and raised in Midwest.  He was not a very adventurous eater.
            I was thrilled to see my husband in love with the first Korean dish that I had ever made for him. I have yet to meet a non-Korean who doesn't like Bulgogi.</p>

            <p>Bulgogi is one of classic Korean dishes where thinly sliced meat is marinated in a sweet and savory sauce made of soy sauce, sugar, 
            and sesame oil, and grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. Literally meaning &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;meat&quot;, this well-known Korean dish 
            has been in existence for nearly over a thousand years.</p>

            <p>Intensely flavorful, it is undoubtedly some of the tastiest dish to put on the grill. When the marinated meat hit the sizzling skillet
            , you can immediately smell the tantalizingly sweet &amp; smoky aroma fills the hot summer air. It is no doubt one of the most well-known
            Korean dishes to non-Koreans.  It&apo;s definitely my husband&apos;s favorite Korean dish.</p>
